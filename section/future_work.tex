\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future_work}


\subsection{Decision Theory}  % How do we *combine* traits?


\subsection{Developing Computational Formalisms}  % We need more than just trust. step 1, identify new formalisms to make. Step 2, create and test new formalisms. 


\subsection{The Problem of Multiple Formalisms}  % We can specify many formalisms for one human trait. Which formalisms are more correct? How do we talk about the qualities of the behaviour the formalism describes, and how it differs from other formalism's descriptions?
