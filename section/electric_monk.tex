\section{An Example: The Electric Monk}
In the novel ``Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency'' by Douglas Adams, there is presented a character who is useful as an example of anthropomorphic algorithms at work. ``The Electric Monk'' is a commercial artificial intelligence which is designed for the purpose of alleviating the burden of ``believing'' in things from the owner, similarly to how a television recorder might ``watch television'' for the owner.\par

This Electric Monk is responsible for killing a local businessman, due to its being told to ``shoot off'' (as in go away) and taking the instruction literally. It then believed that it was imperative that it shoot something.\par

The Electric Monk is an excellent example of anthropomorphic algorithms' strengths and weaknesses.
