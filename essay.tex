\begin{abstract} %%  Perhaps this should be rewritten once the essay draft is complete...
    The space of possible minds is a notion which has quickly permeated AI Safety literature since its introduction in~\cite{Sloman1984TheMinds}. While the concept is useful, it sees rare empirical usage due to the fact tat the structure and nature of the space is difficult to define. This essay presents a technique by which one can model aspects of the expected behaviour of a system through an abstraction over the space. Further, it shows that this technique can apply to both human and artificial intelligences, and create qualitative identities across an arbitrary subspace of the space of possible minds. It explores some of the applications of limitations of this technique, and through the current limitations shows how future work can mitigate these issues to create a stronger practical technique for the exploration of AI Safety.
