    \todo{Rewrite abstract}In philosophy of mind, a recurring topic of philosophical research and popular philosophy is that of the ``mind'' an artificially intelligent agent might possess. A popular method for categorising typical artificially intelligent agents is John Searle's ``weak'' versus ``strong'' AI, where he differentiates between acting intelligently (a ``weak'' AI) and having a mind and mental states (a ``strong'' AI). In this essay, an alternative method for approaching the hard problem of consciousness is presented. This is arrived at by augmenting Sloman's concept of the space of possible minds~\citep{Sloman1984TheMinds} through arguments made using simple yet interesting recent computing science techniques. This argument is explored by applying it as a potential solution to concrete problems of AI safety, such as the problem of Corrigibility~\citep{corrigibility} and Reward Hacking~\citep{concrete_problems}. The efficacy and practical application of the technique is also assessed.
